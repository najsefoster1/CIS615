I have uploaded a resume file for a SharePoint Administrator position to the Resume folder. 
I have uploaded a python file that request the First name, last name and then reply with thank you and use the information requested from the variable to spit out the requested name together to the Unit 1 folder. 
I have uploaded a screenshot to the Unit 2 folder after Unit 2 adjustments of transitioning from First name, last name to Last name, first name and calculating the amount of points for a class and displaying to the end user the amount of points and whether they received max points and stating true or false.
